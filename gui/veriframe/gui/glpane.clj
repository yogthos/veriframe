  "The solution-space pane: the scene graph drawn in a :gl-area.

  A deliberately 2D pipeline — one program, one VBO of interleaved
  [x y r g b], pixel coordinates mapped to NDC in the vertex shader — so the
  transform that draws a node is the same pure `graph/fit` affine that
  answers a click, and picking is exact instead of an unprojection. Edges
  draw as GL_LINES, nodes as quads sized by confirmed-artifact count and
  colored by status; the selected node gets a white backing quad. Geometry
  is rebuilt and re-uploaded per render, which at beam scale (tens of
  nodes) costs nothing.

  All GL state lives here keyed by nothing — one pane per process. The
  pane re-renders when `request-render!` is called (the poll loop and the
  picker call it), coalesced by GTK to one render per frame-clock tick."

  "Clear the cached pointer when GTK tears this widget down.

  This is the fix for the whole class. `:area` is a raw GTK pointer captured in
  on-realize, and nothing in glimmer reports that a widget went away — it has no
  unrealize/destroy hook, and its reconciler destroys a child whenever the slot's
  tag changes, positionally. So the pane could hold a pointer to freed memory
  and go on calling queue_render on it, which GTK answers with

    gtk_gl_area_queue_render: assertion 'GTK_IS_GL_AREA (area)' failed

  and then ignores — no crash, just a pane that drops frames until some later
  realize happens to repopulate the cache.

  Rather than enumerate the ways a widget can die (opening the new-run form is
  one; re-render churn produced the bursts actually observed, at startup and
  when runs first appeared), subscribe to GTK's own answer. `unrealize` fires
  before the widget is destroyed and also on reparenting, and after it the
  cached GL objects belong to a context that is gone, so clearing is right in
  both cases. realize! puts everything back on the way in."
