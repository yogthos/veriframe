  "The optional GUI: a live scene graph of a run's solution space.

  Strictly an HTTP client of the server — this process holds no engines, no
  database handle, and no run state of its own. Everything it shows arrives
  through veriframe.gui.api (the journal cursor doing the tailing), the
  event stream folds through veriframe.gui.graph into the node graph the
  GL pane draws, and everything it does (interventions, abort, resume)
  goes back through a POST. The server neither knows nor cares that a GUI
  exists, which is what keeps `jolt serve` headless."
