  "Ollama's native /api/chat.

  Ollama also exposes an OpenAI-compatible surface at /v1, and pointing the
  openai adapter at it works. This adapter targets the native API instead,
  because that is where Ollama surfaces the things the harness cares about:
  `think` on models that support it, `num_predict` and `num_ctx` under
  `options`, and a `done_reason` that distinguishes hitting the token cap from
  stopping naturally.

  The reply is a single object rather than a choices array, and `stream` has to
  be false explicitly or the body arrives as newline-delimited JSON."
